# Image Processing Learning Journal

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that serve as a learning journal for image processing. The notebooks cover various aspects of image processing.

## What's Inside

1. **Sampling and Quantization**
   - Discover the intricacies of image sampling and quantization.
   - Calculate differences between neighboring pixels.
   - Explore image size and storage in bytes.
   - Experiment with different data types and bias for image representation.
   - Investigate the number of bits required for optimal image quality.

2. **Geometrical Spatial Operations**
   - Dive into spatial operations, including scaling, translation, and rotation.
   - Witness the transformative power of these operations on images.

3. **Histogram Equalization**
   - Gain insights into probability mass functions (PMF) and cumulative mass functions (CMF).
   - Apply histogram equalization and histogram matching transformations.
   - Compare and contrast the resulting histograms.

4. **Filtering in Spatial Domain**
   - Apply a range of spatial filters to images and observe the effects.
     - Average (Mean) filter
     - Median filter
     - Laplacian filter
     - Sobel (X and Y) filter

5. **Filtering in Frequency Domain**
   - Experiment with frequency filters and witness the impact on images.
     - Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT), centered spectrum, decentralized spectrum, and inverse FFT.
     - Ideal Low Pass Filter (ILPF) and Ideal High Pass Filter (IHPF).
     - Gaussian Smoothing with varying kernel sizes.

6. **Morphology Operators**
   - Contribute to our effort to inspect electronic circuit cards.
   - Help count the number of holes and measure their diameters using morphology operators.

7. **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**
   - Participate in the creation of artificial images through data augmentation techniques.
   - Assist in splitting the dataset into training and test sets.
   - Collaborate on building a Convolutional Neural Network with a specified structure.
